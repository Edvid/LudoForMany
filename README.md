# LudoForMany

This application is accessible through `edvid.github.io/LudoForMany`. It was made through blazor firts, and then rewritten into tsx with React. This project was made partly to learn more about React and js/ts XML, partly out of wanting this program to be accessible to more. 

The old blazor app is still accessible on the `legacy-blazor`. The launch guide is in the readme in that branch too
