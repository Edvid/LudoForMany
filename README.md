# LudoForMany

This application is a blazor app. This project was made partly out of sharpening my blazor skills, partly out of wanting to see what a ludo board for a 100 or a 1000 players might look like. 

To run this application. You need:
* dotnet downloaded 

Download this repository to some location on your computer, and note the directory.

Go to your favourite terminal and run the following two commands
```console
cd "[your directory path here]"
dotnet run
``` 

You should then be able to open localhost:5030 in your webbrowser, or whichever port it chose to open at.

I intend to rewrite this in js at some point in the future, so it can all be hosted as a Github Page
